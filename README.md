# Road-Accident-Analysis

Greetings Everyone,

I hope you're doing well. I'm thrilled to share my first Excel project on Road Accident Data and Casualties, using MS Excel which I learned through Rishabh Mishra , Data Tutorials.

# Procedures:

# Data gathering & cleaning:
ðŸ‘‰I imported the CSV file and performed various activities such as applying filters, removing duplicates, fixing errors, and transforming the data into an easily analyzable format.

# Data Processing:
ðŸ‘‰To create trendlines for CY and PY casualties, I added Year and Month columns using the TEXT() function on the Date column.

# Data Analysis and Visualization Pivot Table with Insights Drawn:
ðŸ‘‰Created Total Casualties Data using Pivot Table in Dashboard.
ðŸ‘‰Created a Doughnut chart to analyze the Total casualties & its percentage with respect to accident severity.
ðŸ‘‰Consolidated similar type of vehicle type using Pivot Table analyze option.
ðŸ‘‰Created a Doughnut chart to analyze the maximum casualties by Vehicle type, which was a Car.
ðŸ‘‰Inserted different vehicle type icons through Illustration section and Created a data of Total casualties with respect to Vehicle Type in Dashboard.
ðŸ‘‰Created a Combo 2-D line chart to understand the Monthly trend representing comparison of casualties for CY and PY.
ðŸ‘‰Created a Bar Chart to know the maximum casualties by Road Type.
ðŸ‘‰Consolidated similar type of Road surface condition and Created a Treemap chart to understand the Distribution of total casualties through types of Road Surface.
ðŸ‘‰Consolidated similar Light condition and Created doughnut chart to understand the relation b/w casualties by Area/Location & by Day/Night.

# Enhanced Functionality:
ðŸ‘‰I added filter panels and established connections to all the required pivot tables. Hyperlinks and connections were also added to necessary icons for seamless navigation and created a Data analysis sheet to summarize all the pivot table Data for a developer or client to ease their work and gathered information.
